/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "Gathers all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes. "

const design = "In this design phase of work, the team makes software design decisions regarding the architecture and make of the software solution. This can involve creating design documents, coding guidelines, and discussing the tools, practices, runtimes, or frameworks that will help the team meet the software requirement specification and goals defined in the requirements gathering phase. "

const testing = "In this phase of work, a software implementation is packaged and tested to assure quality. Testing or quality assurance ensures the solutions implemented pass the standard for quality and performance. This can involve unit testing, performing integration and end-to-end tests, verification/validation, and reporting or identifying bugs or defects in the software solution."

const implementation = "In this stage of work, the software is deployed into a production environment. The work gathered, designed, developed, and tested is shared with the consumers and users of the software service. This process involves provisioning infrastructure within an on-premise or cloud provider and defining a software deployment strategy for delivering the changes to a customer."

const maintain = "In this stage of work, the software is operationalized to ensure there are no issues or incidents related to the deployment. This stage of work can involve reviewing, understanding, and monitoring network settings, infrastructure configurations, and performance of application services in production. This process can involve incident resolution or management in the course of any issues or changes made to impact a customer or user base. "
